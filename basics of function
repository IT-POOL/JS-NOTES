 Direct Function Call (Regular Call)
📌 What it is?

The most common way to call a function.
You just write the function name followed by parentheses ().
📌 Use Case:

When you want to execute a function immediately, like showing a message or doing a calculation.
2️⃣ Function Call Using Arguments (With Parameters)
📌 What it is?

You call a function and pass values (arguments) inside the parentheses.
These values are used inside the function to perform different tasks.
📌 Use Case:

When you need to pass dynamic values (e.g., calculating the sum of two numbers or greeting different users).
3️⃣ Function Call Inside Another Function (Nested Function Call)----callback function
📌 What it is?

A function is called inside another function.
The outer function executes first, and then it calls the inner function.
📌 Use Case:

When you want to break complex tasks into smaller functions (e.g., one function for getting user input and another for processing it).
